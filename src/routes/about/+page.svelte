  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    {import.meta.env.VITE_SITE_NAME} is a web app for sharing photos securely with friends and family.
    No more secret Instagrams, or private WhatsApp groups, or Messenger chats, just a simple, self-hosted
    solution.
  </p>
  <p>Sharing private moments is safe, simple, and elegant.</p>
  <h2>How Safe Are My Photos?</h2>
  <p>
    Your photos are only viewable by users who have either the user password or the admin password
    to Traist Photos. Obviously, there is a risk that the password will be circulated, in which
    case, obviously more people would be able to access.
  </p>
  <p>
    Links that you share to photos in Traist Photos can only be opened by someone who has the
    password, so you can be sure that the photos are kept away from prying eyes.
  </p>
  <h3>Technical Details</h3>
  <p>
    Security in transit is provided whenever the site is hosted over an SSL connection. Security at
    rest is a bit more complicated. Traist Photos in its recommended configuration uses an
    encryption key for all photos, which means that your photos are fully encrypted at rest.
    Otherwise, the third party S3 host can be configured to manage Service Side Encryption for you,
    or a private S3 instance can be set up (e.g. Minio). For home users, Backblaze will store 10GB
    of data for free with generous transfer allowances which should be more than enough for most
    people.
